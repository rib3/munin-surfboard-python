#1 is in progress (only 1 downstream, upstream EMPTY)
#2 is in progress? (1 downstream, service = "n/a", ranging = success)
#3 is locked? (service id = 0, Ranging Status = Success)
#4 is in progress? (service id = 49, Ranging Status = Continue)
#5 is in progress? (only 1 downstream, service id = 2, Ranging = Continue)
#6 is partial lock? (only 1 downstream, service id = 49, Ranging = Succcess (other two are ERR/Other)
#7 is locked? (4 downstream, service id = 0, Ranging = Succcess)

#8 is 2 solid, 1 blinking (original comment)
#8 is in progress? (only 1 downstream, service id = n/a, Ranging = continue)

#9 is same state as #8, but unerrored, and correctable are higher
#10 is EARLY progress? 1 downstream (low Power Level), no upstream, no stats
#11 is same as 8? 1 downstream, service id = n/a, Ranging = continue)
#12 is CRAZY early? PARTIAL downstream, no upstream, some stats
#13 is partial lock? (ONLY ONE down, service id = 0, ranging = success)
#14 is locked? (4 down, service id = 0, ranging = success)
#15 is CRAZY locked? (4 down, service id = 49, ranging = TRIPLE!! success)
#16 is like #15, but slight power tweaks, and way higher stat counts

#17 waiting on last light (original comment)
#17 looks locked? Everything seems legit, power/snr is pretty high?

#18 looks EARLY, PARTIAL downstream (no channel id), no upstream, partial stats
#19 looks partial. ONE downstream, service id = n/a, ranging = continue
#20 looks locked, power seems HIGH, "other" ranging is "T4 Time Out"
